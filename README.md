# Grocery Store Application

Hey there! Welcome to the Grocery Store Application. I'm excited to introduce you to this python project where we've built a grocery store management application using a three-tier architecture:

1. **Front end:** The user interface is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
2. **Backend:** We've used Python and Flask to power the application.
3. **Database:** To store and manage data, we rely on MySQL.

## Installation Instructions

To get started with the Grocery Store Application, follow these simple installation steps:

1. Download MySQL for Windows from the official website: [MySQL Installer](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).
2. Install the required Python package by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install mysql-connector-python
   ```

That's it! You're all set up and ready to go.

## To-Do List

We're continuously working on improving the Grocery Store Application. Here are some tasks on our to-do list:

- [ ] **Products Module - Edit Functionality:** Add an edit button on the products page to allow users to modify existing product information.

- [ ] **Products Module - Add New UOM:** Implement a new form to enable users to add new Units of Measurement (UOM) in the application.

- [ ] **Orders Module - Input Validation:** Improve the order placement process by adding validation for customer names and other details.

- [ ] **Orders Module - Fix Total Price Bug:** Address the bug on the new order page, where manually changing the total price of an item does not update the grand total.

- [ ] **Orders Module - View Order Details:** Add a "View" button in the orders grid to display detailed order information, including individual items, prices, and quantities.

Happy coding! :rocket:
